# comparing-different-Ml-algorithms
I compared the accuracy of 4 different ML algorithms- logistic regression, decision tree, KNN and elasticNet. The hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV to get the optimal parameters. The cross validation score was kept fixed at cv=3 for all. 75% of data was used for training and 25% for testing. 
My output comprises RMSE, accuracy_score and classification report. Overall, decision tree showed the best performance with 95.1% while ElasticNet showed lowest with 53.4% accuracy.
P.S. the result might not be 100% accurate as I did not scale the data initially. Moreover, I tried on my level of knowledge so please let me know if I am missing something.
